Stellar Object Classification using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Dataset. 

Project Overview:

This project focuses on the classification of celestial objects—stars, galaxies, and quasars—using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The SDSS dataset provides extensive photometric and spectroscopic data that enables machine learning models to accurately identify and categorize stellar objects based on their observed features.

Accurate classification of these objects is essential for astronomical research, aiding in the understanding of the universe’s structure and the evolution of celestial bodies. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to automate the classification process and provide insights into the distinguishing characteristics of different astronomical objects.

Dataset

The SDSS dataset includes features such as:

Photometric magnitudes in multiple bands (u, g, r, i, z)

Redshift values

Spectral line information

Other observational parameters

These features are used to train models to differentiate between stars, galaxies, and quasars.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover data patterns

Multiple machine learning models for classification

Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of results and feature importance

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, Ada Boost, XG Boost)
